## Description

This project aims to predict Tesla's (TSLA) stock prices based on historical data. We use an LSTM neural network due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.  

The main steps of the project are:  

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, and `yahoo_fin`.  
2. **Data Preparation**: Collecting and preprocessing stock price data.  
3. **Model Construction**: Defining the architecture of the LSTM neural network.  
4. **Model Training**: Training the model with historical data.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance and visualizing results.  

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system, along with the following libraries:  

- numpy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- torch  
- yahoo_fin

> The dataset was extracted using the <code>yahoo_fin</code> library, which allows retrieving financial data such as stock market prices. This enables us to extract data to determine stock closing values.  

## Results

The following graph shows a comparison between the actual Tesla stock prices and the modelâ€™s predictions:
